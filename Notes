SVG ------------------------------------------------

What is it?

1. Scale to any size, retain quality and no change in file size
2. Can be modified programmatically
3. Scalable Vector Graphics.
4. use maths as opposed to grid of pixels as in tradition "rastor graphics"
5. Defined using XML 
6. Better for simple image, more complex the structure more ineffecient it is.
Cause you have to store at last in XML

So let's get familiar with some parts of SVG.

1. viewBox --> the view bounds of your SVG
2. class, id --> can be used to target an SVG element using JS and CSS
3. circle, rect, path, text --> basic building blocks

Two ways to embed SVG

1. using link. like in img tag in html or background property in CSS
    The issue with this is you cannot access SVG code
2. using inline. This way you can access SVG code via CSS and JS.
    Here the problem can be, webpage is less cacheable. Take time to render.

Played around with SVG. Check out tutSVG.
Learned about some basic animations, keyframe animation and how can i target my svg elements
from CSS and JS

Tables in HTML -------------------------------------

When you should not use tables?

You should use tables with tabular data and not use fot things like
lay out your web page. One row for header, one row for column and such


some drawbacks if you do so:- 
1. Layout tables reduce accesibilty for visually impaired
2. Tables produce tag soup
3. Tables are not automatically responsive

Nested tables are generally not recommended and they are hard to implement.
