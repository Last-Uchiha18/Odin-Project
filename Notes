Emmet ----------------------------------------------- 

1 --> cmd+k followed by cmd+s opens the emmet actions page
you can find all the action here. Can assign your on shortcuts here

2 --> ctrl+cmd+r --> remove tag emmet action
3 --> ctrl+cmd+w --> wrap the selected content in a tag

4 --> selector.className creates the selector with that class.
5 --> you can also add attributes like selector[attribueName]

6 --> head>nav>ul and so on, will create something like below i.e. children

<head>
    <nav>
        <ul></ul>
    </nav>
</head>

7 --> header>nav>ul>li*3{List Item $}. For creating a list automatically

<header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>List Item 1</li>
            <li>List Item 2</li>
            <li>List Item 3</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>

8 --> header+main+footer, will help in creating in siblings

<header></header>
<main></main>
<foot></foot>

9 --> Exercise

<h1 class="name-1"></h1>
<h1 class="name-2"></h1>
<h1 class="name-3"></h1>

SVG ------------------------------------------------

What is it?

1. Scale to any size, retain quality and no change in file size
2. Can be modified programmatically
3. Scalable Vector Graphics.
4. use maths as opposed to grid of pixels as in tradition "rastor graphics"
5. Defined using XML 
6. Better for simple image, more complex the structure more ineffecient it is.
Cause you have to store at last in XML

So let's get familiar with some parts of SVG.

1. viewBox --> the view bounds of your SVG
2. class, id --> can be used to target an SVG element using JS and CSS
3. circle, rect, path, text --> basic building blocks

Two ways to embed SVG

1. using link. like in img tag in html or background property in CSS
    The issue with this is you cannot access SVG code
2. using inline. This way you can access SVG code via CSS and JS.
    Here the problem can be, webpage is less cacheable. Take time to render.

Played around with SVG. Check out tutSVG.
Learned about some basic animations, keyframe animation and how can i target my svg elements
from CSS and JS

Tables in HTML -------------------------------------

When you should not use tables?

You should use tables with tabular data and not use fot things like
lay out your web page. One row for header, one row for column and such


some drawbacks if you do so:- 
1. Layout tables reduce accesibilty for visually impaired
2. Tables produce tag soup
3. Tables are not automatically responsive

Nested tables are generally not recommended and they are hard to implement.

Default Styles in CSS -------------------------------------

The browser provides some default styling. It can lead to some
minor inconsistencies. So we need to do CSS reset to ensure
our styling is same accross all browsers.

CSS Units -----------------------------------------------

1. Absolute units --> Always same in any context.
px is the only absolute unit you should use for your web 
projects.

2. Relative units --> The units which change based on their context.

    a) em and rem -> both are relative units. Prefer rem.

            em -> font-size of the element (or it's parent)
            eg. if element font-size is 16 px. 4em = 64px

            rem -> font-size of root element.

            em can get complex, as it's size changes if the context changes

    b) Viewport Units

        The units vw and vh are relative to the user's viewport size.
        1vh = 1% of user's viewport's height


We use relative units to improve accessibility. as rem and em changes, px does not.
(if user has changed the size of text of their browser)

rem for font-size, px for everything else.

Viewport Minimum(vmin) --> %age of vh or vw, whichever is smaller.
Viewport Maximum(vman) --> %age of vh or vw, whichever is larger
            |
            |
They can be used anywhere -> font-weight, border, padding, margins etc.

font-size: calc(16px+ 0.5vh);
something like this can be use to have relative font size

A lot of things can be done using viewports.
This was handy artcle https://css-tricks.com/fun-viewport-units/

If you use a percentage for a width value, it will be percentage width of 
the parent element. (just like em)
