Emmet ----------------------------------------------- 

1 --> cmd+k followed by cmd+s opens the emmet actions page
you can find all the action here. Can assign your on shortcuts here

2 --> ctrl+cmd+r --> remove tag emmet action
3 --> ctrl+cmd+w --> wrap the selected content in a tag

4 --> selector.className creates the selector with that class.
5 --> you can also add attributes like selector[attribueName]

6 --> head>nav>ul and so on, will create something like below i.e. children

<head>
    <nav>
        <ul></ul>
    </nav>
</head>

7 --> header>nav>ul>li*3{List Item $}. For creating a list automatically

<header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>List Item 1</li>
            <li>List Item 2</li>
            <li>List Item 3</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>

8 --> header+main+footer, will help in creating in siblings

<header></header>
<main></main>
<foot></foot>

9 --> Exercise

<h1 class="name-1"></h1>
<h1 class="name-2"></h1>
<h1 class="name-3"></h1>

SVG ------------------------------------------------

What is it?

1. Scale to any size, retain quality and no change in file size
2. Can be modified programmatically
3. Scalable Vector Graphics.
4. use maths as opposed to grid of pixels as in tradition "rastor graphics"
5. Defined using XML 
6. Better for simple image, more complex the structure more ineffecient it is.
Cause you have to store at last in XML

So let's get familiar with some parts of SVG.

1. viewBox --> the view bounds of your SVG
2. class, id --> can be used to target an SVG element using JS and CSS
3. circle, rect, path, text --> basic building blocks

Two ways to embed SVG

1. using link. like in img tag in html or background property in CSS
    The issue with this is you cannot access SVG code
2. using inline. This way you can access SVG code via CSS and JS.
    Here the problem can be, webpage is less cacheable. Take time to render.

Played around with SVG. Check out tutSVG.
Learned about some basic animations, keyframe animation and how can i target my svg elements
from CSS and JS

Tables in HTML -------------------------------------

When you should not use tables?

You should use tables with tabular data and not use fot things like
lay out your web page. One row for header, one row for column and such


some drawbacks if you do so:- 
1. Layout tables reduce accesibilty for visually impaired
2. Tables produce tag soup
3. Tables are not automatically responsive

Nested tables are generally not recommended and they are hard to implement.

Default Styles in CSS -------------------------------------

The browser provides some default styling. It can lead to some
minor inconsistencies. So we need to do CSS reset to ensure
our styling is same accross all browsers.

CSS Units -----------------------------------------------

1. Absolute units --> Always same in any context.
px is the only absolute unit you should use for your web 
projects.

2. Relative units --> The units which change based on their context.

    a) em and rem -> both are relative units. Prefer rem.

            em -> font-size of the element (or it's parent)
            eg. if element font-size is 16 px. 4em = 64px

            rem -> font-size of root element.

            em can get complex, as it's size changes if the context changes

    b) Viewport Units

        The units vw and vh are relative to the user's viewport size.
        1vh = 1% of user's viewport's height


We use relative units to improve accessibility. as rem and em changes, px does not.
(if user has changed the size of text of their browser)

rem for font-size, px for everything else.

Viewport Minimum(vmin) --> %age of vh or vw, whichever is smaller.
Viewport Maximum(vman) --> %age of vh or vw, whichever is larger
            |
            |
They can be used anywhere -> font-weight, border, padding, margins etc.

font-size: calc(16px+ 0.5vh);
something like this can be use to have relative font size

A lot of things can be done using viewports.
This was handy artcle https://css-tricks.com/fun-viewport-units/

If you use a percentage for a width value, it will be percentage width of 
the parent element. (just like em)

More Text Styles -----------------------------------------------

Now on we use font-family, to avoid the scenario where the font
that gets used is default HTML font cause its ugly.

Another way is to use online font libraries. They usually give some API url and
you can import it in your CSS. It maybe a link tag or import tag. Make sure to have 
a fallback font in case you know, the API URL changes or it is down.

Some Text Styles

1. font-style --> italics and all.
use <em> tag for emphasis and not making text italics</em>
if you want your text to be italics use font-style

2. letter-spacing --> change spacing between letters
3. line-height --> space between lines in case of wrapping text.
4. text-transform --> basically make text upper, lower case
5. text-shadows

ellipsis? I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AS OF NOW

More CSS Properties -----------------------------------

shorthand properties --> These are the properties that if you set them you basically
set multiple other properties related to it. Like background is one of them. Using it
we can define background-color, background-image, background-repeat etc.

1. background property --> so it sets color, image, size and origin all at once.
if something is not defined it fallbacks to default value.

there were 8 properties related to this. Damn, but i know the function of each one.

2. Border property --> border and border-radius. Now border is less compliacted than background.
It has three related properties; size, style and color.

3. Box shadow --> adds a shadow effect around elements.
if border radius is defined on the element, shadow also has radius.
it has properties; offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, spread-radius, color.
(2 value, 3rd adds blur-radius, 4th adds spread-radius)

4. Overflow --> what happens when the content inside an element is bigger than it can hold or contain.
it has two properties (overflow-x, overflow-y)

possible values are
    a) clip -> like hidden but no scrolling allowed, not even programmatically. (clipped at margins)
    b) hidden -> hides overflowing content.(programmatically scrolling is allowed) (cliiped at padding)
    c) visible -> makes it visible.
    d) scroll -> makes the content scrollable (from padding)
    e) auto -> like visible if not overflown, like scroll if overflown. (from padding)

Advanced Selectors -----------------------------------------------

">" ; the child combinator
"+" ; the adjacent sibling combinator
"~" ; the general sibling combinator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A little detour; just got to know i skipped the foundations course. So I will get back there
and learn some concepts which i don't know. So let's go.

Starting off with Selectors:-

1. Universal Selector "*"
    It will select element of any type.

2. Type Selector 

    Just by using the name of the tag like div, p etc.

    Eg. div {
            color: red;
        }

3. Class Selector

    Just by using a class name of the element. A class name can be used with multiple elements.
    Syntax:     .class-Name {

                }

4. ID Selector 
    The main difference between class and ID is it cannnot be repeated on a single page and each element can have only
    one ID. Use IDs sparingly if at all.

    Syntax: #id {

            }
    
5. Grouping Selector
    class names or ids or any other selector types separated by a comma.

6. Chaining Selectors

7. Descendant combinator

    Now how this works is a element will be selected only if its parent is of that class.

    Eg. Consider two classes .ancestor and .child

        .ancestor .child {
            this will select only those elements which have class child and whose parents have a class ancestor
        }

Lastly order in which you define style for a selector matters. Only the last one is applied.

For an image not to lose proportion, use auto for height and adjust the width
It is good to specify, in case the image is slow to load there won't be dramatic shifting of the other content after it 
gets loaded

External CSS -> Create a separated file and include with link tag
Internal CSS -> Define in style tag in same HTML file
Inline CSS -> Define in the tag itself.

Inline CSS will override the other two methods.

Specificity --->  ID > class > type

more the number of class more is the Specificity
combinators do not add to Specificity and Universal selector too.

Finally to break all ties the rule which was last written is used.

The Box Model-----------------------------------------

So, today i will learn how to position the elements correctly. I never understood it properly
But today it ends, let's do it.

Firstly, every single things on a page is a box.

padding --> between content and border
margin --> between border and border (two different boxes)
border --> adds space between margin and padding

When two boxes have margin defined on them, its not like the margin will be the sum of two. Rather it will be the max of the two.
if both positive
if one margin is positive and other is negative then the resulting is one subtracted from other.
if both negative then smaller of the two is the result.

So the height calculated in browser is like = height+padding * 2+ border * 2

But if you don't want this and want the height you defined. 
Use box-sizing: border-box property.

An inline element does not respect width and height.

display: inline-block --> use it to have some properties of in-line and some of block.
like height and width will be respected but the item will break into new line.
Margin, border and padding will cause other content to be pushed away.

displays covered till now 
1. Block
2. inline
3. inline-block

auto value can be used to center an element horizontally.
it has to be used with width, otherwise auto will asign zero value and it will have no affect.

"will not center elements vertically".

Flex Box------------------------------------------------

Flex container and flex item

    Flex container is any element that has display property as flex defined on it.
    Any element that is inside a element with flex display property is a flex item.

    Now an element can both be a flex container and flex item.

Flex shorthand: So flex has three properties
    a) Flex-grow
    b) Flex-shrink
    c) Flex-basis

so when you define flex:1;
it is like Flex-grow: 1, Flex-shrink: 1, Flex-basis: 0

What happens is the elements grow and shrink in size according to the size of the container.
(on defining display: flex)

Now,
    Flex-grow: This defines the factor by which your element will grow. If on one element it is defined as two, this means 
    it will grow twice the size of others.

    Flex-shrink: Same like flex-grow just when its shrinking and not growing.
    Only applies when the size of all flex items is larger than their container.
    Default value is 1

    Lastly,
    Flex-basis: Defines the baseline from which other properties start. It means the element will have this width by default or somethinglike this.
    Default value is 0. And if we define auto the items will respect the width define on it.


    flex: initial --> flex: 0 1 auto
    flex: none --> flex: 0 0  auto
    flex: auto --> flex: 1 1 autp
    flex: <+ve number> --> flex: <+ve number> 1 0

    By default flex items won't shrink below their minimum content size.

Axes ------------------------------------------------

Now we can arrange flex items in two directions, vertical and horizontal.
This can be set using "flex-direction" property and some rules change depending on the direction you are working in.
Default is horizontal direction.

No matter what's the direction, think of your flex items as having two axes; one main axis and other cross axis.

main-axis --> vertical in vertical, simple as that.

One thing to note is, flex:1 won't work on when stacked vertically.
Since the flex-basis will be 0 and calculations start from flex basis, and
the div have by default 0 height and for an element to fill zero height they need not have any height at all.

Therefore we need to use, flex-basis: auto. this will tell to use the default height given to the flex element.
Flex-basis refer to height when flex-direction is vertical (kind of obvious).

What happens in horizontal is block level elements default to the width of their parents
That's why we have no issues horizontally. But in vertical the same elements have height equal to
the content, and if there is none it will be zero. Therefore there's a complexity in using column
flex-direction.

justify-content --> justifies item along the main axis.
aign-items --> aligns items along the cross axis.
align-self --> this property is applied to the flex item and not the container.
allows you to change alignment of one child accross the cross axis.

Gap is a property you can define on the container and it adds space between the flex items. handy!

You can use flex-wrap: wrap;  when flex items are more than the container can hold.

Woah! Today We learned a really important topic, FLEX BOX.

Some additional concepts:-

1. Primary axis: Children will be bunched up at the start of the container.
2. Cross axis: Children will stretch out to fill the container.

So flex-basis gives the hypothetical size. If flex items are bigger than this hypothetical size, flex shrink will
come into picture since the items need to shrink and vice verca.
But here's a catch, the flex shrink allows items to shrink only upto a particular size, after that it overflows.
This is the "min-width". To solve this we can set "min-width: 0" on the flex child.

Auto margin will gobble up the extra space and apply it to the element's margin.

If we add two numbers, the result is a number.
If one of the number is a string, the result is a String with two of them concatenated.

** JS interpreter works from left to right!

** JavaScript will convert strings to numbers in all numeric operation! (except +)

NaN is not a number. like 10 / "Apple" will give NaN.

But the typeof NaN is a number.

We can create objects out of JS numbers using "new" operator.

To convert String to Integer use --> Number(str)

"+", when used as an unary operator does nothng but act
just like Nmber(...).

like, let a = "3", b = "5"

    let c = Number(3) + Number(5)
    let d = +3 + +5
    c === d

Increment and decrement operator can only be used with a variable
and not a number.

like ++a (a being a variable), ++1: the latter will give an error

null becomes 0 after numeric conversion.
undefined becomes NaN after numeric conversion.

\ escape characters

`` use them to define a string if you want some to be evalauted in the expression.
`Hello, ${user.name}`

`` these are called template literals and they respect the line break in code.
\n use this to line break in "" these strings

str.slice(1, 4) same a python's str[1:4]
works with negs too just like python.
.substring same as slice, does not support negs.
.substr() same as slice but second parameter is length of slice not index.
but it supports negs.

All String Methods return a new string since strings are immutable types.

str.charAt(2) is same as str[2] in python. Tho you can use the same in JS too i.e. str[2]
str.charCodeAt(2) is same as ord(str[2])

split(" ") works same as python.

the equality check "==" for undefined and null is defined such that, without any conversion,
they equal each other and don't equal anything else.

Precedence of && is higher than ||.

alert(); does not return anything.

In switch case, === is used for checking equality.

HTML represents initial page while DOM represents current page content.
DOM is basically tree like structure of the HTML tage.

Functions that are part of objects (i.e class or structs type) are called methods.
Functions are always hoisted so you can call it anywhere, unlike Python.

When using something like addEventListener("name", functionName)
The functionName is not followed by parantheses, and is called automatically when the event happens.

parameter is what is inside the function declaration. Argument is what we send when calling the function.

Callbacks are functions which are passed as function arguments and are expected
to be called later (probably in that function).


Function declaration:-
    function name() {

    }

Function expression:-
    let a = function() {

    }

Same as swift concept of lazy var, it is created when called

sayHi("John"); // Hello, John

function sayHi(name) {
  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
}

Above one will work

sayHi("John"); // error!

let sayHi = function(name) {  // (*) no magic any more
  alert( `Hello, ${name}` );
};

Above one will not, since it is not created yet.


Global execution context and Function execution context.
Latter one is created everytime a function is called and that function is pushed on top of call stack.

Now the stack has a fixed size; if exceeded results in stack overflow error.

Understanding Errors:--
    1. Reference Error -> When one refers to a variable not defined in the current scope.
    2. Syntax Error
    3. Type Error -> Wrong argument to a function. Changing a const variable. Using value in an inappropriate way.

Serializable object --> One that can be deconstructed and passed between systems/languages. And can later be constructed again.

pop() -> pop from last.
push() -> append in array.
shift() -> pop from start.
unshift() -> add at start.

Moving on to using JS to manipulate DOM.
HTML parsed by browser -> Gives DOM -> Which has nodes -> Which are objects with many properties and methods.
We can these properties and methods to manipulate them.

1. Query Selector:-
    a. element.querySelector(selector) -> gives first match
    b. element.querySelectorAll(selectors) -> gives references to all nodes.
       This returns nodeList which is not array. We can convert it into array using spread operator or Array.from()

2. Element Creation:- 
    Used to create elements. This merely creates it (in the DOM) and we can add styles and all and then add it to our HTML.

3. Add Elements:-
    parentNode.appendChild(childElement) -> adds as the last child of the parent
    parentNode.insertBefore(childElement, referenceNode)

4. Remove Elements:-
    parentNode.removeChild(child) -> removes and returns a reference to the child.

We can get the style object using element.style and use to define several inline CSS properties.
Keep in mind that access properties use camel Case for hyphen including properties.

Example -> for border-width; use element.borderWidth = 10px;
And if property is a keyword in JS, append the property with 'css'.

5. Editing attributes:- 

    getAttribute()
    setAttribute()
    removeAttribute()

6. Add/remove class -> element.classList.toggle(className). If its there it removes else it add.

7. Adding text content -> element.textContent = "ahaha";

8. Adding HTML element -> element.innerHTML = "<span> Fuck <span/>"


NOTE -->>> Keep in mind the JS does not alter HTML, just the DOM and JS changes what the browser renders.

if using JS in HTML, make sure to add it at end of the file. Your JS will run, and then DOM elements will be created. Resulting in 
many DOM manipulating methods not available.

Callbacks are nothing but function (as they are objects in JS) being passed around as parameters of other object.

Browsers capture in the event starting from the top i.e body tag and then it goes outward (bubble up) firing those events.
There's a third parameter on add event listener i.e. capture which we can use to tell whther to run the callback function on
capture down or bubble up.

e.stopPropagation() can be used to stop bubble up.

Property names in objects can be string or symbols, other types are converted to string automatically. And we can also use reserved
keywords as property name like for, return etc.

We can use "in" keyword to check if there's a property in our object.
like "mom" in house

The properties of objects are ordered in a special way.
if the property names are number then they are sorted, otherwise they remain in creation order.
Basically if they are integer properties. Integer properties are those whose string and integer value are both same.

Back to CSS----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Descendant combinator selects are the childs of the parent one, no matter how deeply nested they are.
But we want to select only the next child and not the grandchild and so on.
We can use child combinator '>'.

'+' sibling combinator selects only the next element, with the same level of indentation (if present).
keep in mind it has to just next. Nothing should be between the two.

'~' to select all siblings

Pseudo Classes -- are prefixed with a colon.
Some of them are:-

    a. Dynamic and User interaction Pseudo-classes
        1. :hover --> when hovering mouse pointer.
        2. :active --> when an element is clicked.
        3. :focus --> when clicked or keyboard used.
        4. :link --> to all links.
        5. :visited --> if links are visited.
    
    b. Structural Pseudo-classes
        1. :root --> to apply rules everywhere, it is the top element.
        2. :first-child --> matches first child
        3. :last-child --> matches last child
        4. :empty --> one with no children
        5. :only-child --> one with no siblings.
        6. :nth-child

        .myList:nth-child(5) --> selects 5th child
        .myList:nth-child(3n) --> selects every 3rd child child
        .myList:nth-child(3n+3) --> selects every 3rd child, begining with third.

Difference between :root and html. :root has greater specificity than html, it being a pseudo class.

Pseudo Elements -- prefixed with ::

    ::marker --> to customize styling of your lists.
    ::first-letter
    ::first-line
    ::selection --> to apply style to what happens when user selects text
    ::before and ::after --> add extra elements to the page.

Attribute Selectors.
    Same specificity as classes and pseudo classes
    Three ways to select attributes (these are what's inside the opening html tag)
    1. [attribute Name] --> [src]. Selects all element that has a src attribute.
    2. selector[attribute name] --> img[src]. Selects all image elements which have a src attribute.
    3. [attribute=value] --> selects element with this attribute and value

    Regex
    attribute^="value" --> starts with
    attribute$="value" --> ends with
    attribute*="value" --> contains

!important, the only way it can be over ridden is by other !important.

CSS Positioning --> This has always been elusive to me. Let's get it done this time.

Avoid absolute positioning. Use fixed position for elements like header, if is relative to user's viewport, so even if they scroll it will remain
where it is.

Relative --> relative to itself. Removes the element from the normal flow of the document.
so if we give top: 10px; it will shift 10px down from where it normally would have been.
This opens up two avenues --> 1. absolute positioning 2. z-index

Absolute --> position is relative to the element having position relative, takes out of the document flow and place element exactl where you want.

CSS functions
1. max --> evident from name
2. min --> evident from name
3. calc --> to perform some calculations
4. clamp() --> takes three arguments i.e. the smalles value, the ideal value, the largest value.

Variables do not work inside media and container queries. Though you can define them there like:-

@media () {
    :root {
        --var-name: value;
    }
}

something like this.
We can use JS function to get and set property
getPropertyValue('--my-var'), setProperty('--my-var', 16px)

Moving on to forms....

Form element is used. It's like a div and has all the inputs user will do.
It has two attributes. One action which tells us where to send the data, where it will be processed and second is method.
get request or post request.

name attribute (on input element) is used in back-end to extract data from the json sent by the form.

Field set is used to group common fields together in a form. Legend is used to give title to the field set.

CSS Grid -------------------------------------------------

grid-template: no. of rows/ no. of columns
Above one is shorthand for the below ones.

grid-template-rows: no. of rows
grid-template-columns: no. of columns

Now in case we have less grid rows and cols but more items, there is concept of implicit grid.
where in the grid automatically extends.
We can set the size for this automatically extended item using
1. grid-auto-rows
2. grid-auto-columns

We can use gap (same as flex). But it is shorthand in this case for
---> column-gap and row-gap
